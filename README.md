# ODAQ-SDA
 Applying Categorical Exploratory Data Analysis (CEDA) methods to study audio quality perception. Original dataset was published by Torcoli et al., 2023.

 ## Overview
 This project analyzes the ODAQ dataset to examine expert and student evaluations of audio quality. The primary objective is to identify patterns in their assessments and quantify their agreement with an ideal ranking using statistical and clustering techniques. By analyzing listener and audio sample clusters, this study aims to explore the audio characteristics that contribute to specific scores and ranking outcomes.
