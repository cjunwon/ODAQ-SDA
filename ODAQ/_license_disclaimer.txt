The audio files contained in the ODAQ package are distributed with different licenses, i.e., CC BY, CC BY-NC, and CC0.
For the details please refer to _detailed_license.csv, which details the license for each original unprocessed file (contained in ./ODAQ_unprocessed).

For each processed file in ./ODAQ_training, ./ODAQ_listening_test, and ./ODAQ_DE_raw_outputs the same license applies as for the original unprocessed file from which the processed file is derived.

The processing methods applied to the original unprocessed files are described in our paper mentioned below.
